# split-terminal-on-startup README

## Features

Super simple extension that slices your integrated terminal into two.

Personally I like to run one terminal instance for build tools like `gulp` alongside one for other tasks like `git` commands etc. I got tired of hitting the keyboard shortcut on startup constantly, so this extension was born!

## Requirements

None.

## Extension Settings

Currently none. Planning to add a setting in the future to allow splitting into 3/4/5+ terminals.

## Known Issues

None as of yet.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

First, extremely basic, version.
